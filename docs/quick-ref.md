## Fate Points

Fate Points can be spent to:
1. Invoke an Aspect
2. Compel an Aspect
3. Declare a Story Detail
4. Power a Stunt

Fate Points can be earned in three ways:
1. Accepting a Compel
2. Have your Character Aspects and Consequences invoked against you with Fate Points
3. Concede from a conflict

You can earn more Fate Points than your maximum refresh! 

Fate Points replenish between sessions, *except* when continuing combat through multiple sessions.
