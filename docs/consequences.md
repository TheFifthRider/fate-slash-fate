# Consequence Break Bar System

Each character has a **consequence stress track** for each consequence they can suffer -- Mild, Moderate, and Severe. Next to that stress track is a **consequence slot** that can be marked as **in recovery**.

Damage dealt to a character first fills up their Mild stress track, then Moderate and so on. Unless a character has a stunt which specifies otherwise, extra damage beyond what would fill a stress track does **not** transfer to the next stress track unless the extra shifts would fill up another stress track.

When a stress track fills up, fill in the associated consequence slot and the enemy creates a free invoke on that consequence. That stress track stays filled and cannot be emptied until you treat that consequence.  

## Extreme Consequence Bar
If a character has all of their consequence stress tracks filled, they are **taken out** unless they wish to use their **extreme consequence bar**.  An extreme consequence bar is an extra stress track, but at the end of a scene in which it is used (regardless of whether it was filled or not), clear it and permanently replace one of your six character aspects that is not an extreme consequence already with an extreme consequence.

## Recovering from Consequences

After a scene that allows you to rest and recover, you may mark any number of consequences that you can justify you treated in that scene as **in recovery** by marking the associated box next to the consequence and clearing that stress bar, allowing you to use it again. 

However, until that consequence fully heals you are still vulnerable. Whenever a scene starts that might aggravate your in-recovery consequence (like starting a fight, for instance), a **free invoke** is placed on it.

You may clear a consequence after a certain amount of time in recovery:

| Severity | Time |
|--------|------|
| Mild | One scene |
| Moderate | One session |
| Severe | Three sessions |
