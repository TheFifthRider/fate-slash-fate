# Extras: Magecraft & Noble Phantasms

## Noble Phantasms

Each individual Servant is also granted a Noble Phantasm upon character creation. Noble Phantasms are extras that are specific to the Servant. As such they must be discussed with the DMs upon character creation as they are highly specialized. 

If a character might have multiple Noble Phantasms in lore either weaker or more passive Noble Phantasms may be turned into Stunts ala how Fate/Grand Order handles multiple NPs OR can be folded into the Extra as a Stunt. Most NPs will have their own cost associated with them.

### Example Noble Phantasm: Gilgamesh

Gilgamesh possesses immense strength with his Noble Phantasm-- a strength limited only by his pride in how frivolously he uses it. He has 3 special Fate Points called Pride that can be used to power his Noble Phantasm Stunts. When Compelled or Hostilely Invoked, his Noble Phantasm Aspects grant him Pride instead of Fate Points.

Whenever you gain a Significant Milestone, you may increase his Pride by 1 or add an additional Noble Phantasm Stunt that uses Pride instead of increasing his refresh.

Pride: 3/3

#### Aspects: 
***Gate of Babylon: The King's Treasure***

#### Stunts:
**My Treasury Contains Thousands of Noble Phantasms**
You can spend a point of Pride in place of a Fate Point to invoke Gate of Babylon: The King's Treasure and make a special Buster attack, volleying the contents of the limitless treasury at a foe. You may reroll the dice or add +3 to the result of that roll.

**Enuma Elish: The Star of Creation That Split Heaven and Earth**
Spend all of your remaining Pride in an all out Buster attack with the full power of Enuma Elish. Add +3 to the roll for each point of Pride spent on the attack.

# Magecraft
Masters receive a highly specialized Extra known as “Magecraft” instead of the Class abilities and Noble Phantasms. By its very nature, Magecraft is also highly specialized and changes depending on the character and their form of Magecraft they empoy. 

Each Magecraft will have codified spells that the Magus can access at any time but it will also function as an Aspect which can be called upon to attempt to perform feats that would fall under the Magecrafts purview which are not codified within the Extra.
