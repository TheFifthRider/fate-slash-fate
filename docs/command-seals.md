# Command Seals 

Command Seals are three incredibly powerful Magic Seals which represent the contract between Master and Servant. The primary purpose behind the creation of Command Seals was to force a Servant to do something they otherwise would refuse to do, but Masters can also use Seals as a way of powering up their Servant by commanding them to do great feats. While most Command Seals will be used in this latter way, the primary use is a great source of drama and is encouraged. 

Be reasonable. If a character refuses to do something it's one thing, but if a Player has a major reason why they wish to not follow the Command Spell of their Master, that's obviously taking priority. It's meant for drama and as part of the world building, not to get each other angry.

## Using Command Seals
When a Command Seal is used, the order is codified as an Aspect. In addition to being a source of compels, Command Seal Aspects can be invoked for a +3 toward relevant Actions instead of a +2.

Command Seals will regenerate after each Singularity once you make a new contract with a different Servant.
