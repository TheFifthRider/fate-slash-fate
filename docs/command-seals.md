# Command Seals 

Command Seals are three incredibly powerful Magic Seals which represent the contract between Master and Servant. By expending a Command Seal, a Master releases an extraordinary magical force.

Mages originally created Command Seals to assert dominance over their summoned Servants. As familiars with souls, Servants are completely capable of denying their summoner's will and acting on their own. Through the power of Command Seals, mages could force their Servants to do whatever they wanted...or prevent them from retaliatory action.

More benignly, Masters can also use Seals as a way of powering up their Servant by commanding them to do great feats. 

Either way, when a Command is issued with a Command Seal, the Servant is obligated by their contract to do everything they can to see the order through to its completion. Depending on the Command, a Servant may be able to attempt resistance or subversion, but the contract can  physically overpower them

??? warning
    While most Command Seals will be used in the latter way, their original intended use is a great source of drama and is encouraged. But be reasonable and respect the wishes of other players if they have an objection to their character being bound by a Command.

## Using Command Seals

When a Command Seal is used, the order is codified as an Aspect with 2 Free Invokes, just as if you Succeeded with Style on Creating an Advantage. 

In addition to being a source of [compels](aspects), Command Seal Aspects can be invoked for a +3 toward relevant Actions instead of a +2.

A Singularity begins with 3 Command Seals shared by all Masters in the party. Command Seals will regenerate after each Singularity once you make a new contract with a different Servant.
