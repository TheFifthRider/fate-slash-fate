# Magecraft & Saint Graphs

If your character is a Master candidate or other Magus, they will have a Magecraft. If your character is a Servant, they will have a Saint Graph. Either way, these extras are unique to your character, and as such they must be discussed with your GM upon character creation as they are highly specialized. 

In their most basic form, Saint Graphs and Magecrafts consist of three stunts and a unique resource, such as _Devil Points_, _Memory_, or _Marks of Sincerity_. However you should feel free to customize them with your GM however you like to suit your character.

## Saint Graphs
Each Servant character has a Saint Graph, which is an extra that codifies their Noble Phantasms and other pieces of their Spirit Origin.

### Example Saint Graph: Gilgamesh
> Gilgamesh possesses immense strength with his Noble Phantasm-- a strength limited only by his pride in how frivolously he uses it. He has 3 points of Pride that can be used to power his Noble Phantasm Stunts. When Compelled or Hostilely Invoked, his Noble Phantasm Aspects grant him Pride instead of Fate Points.
>
>Whenever you would increase his refresh, you may instead increase his Pride by 1 or add an additional Noble Phantasm Stunt that uses Pride.

#### Resource:
Pride: 3/3

#### Aspects: 

***Gate of Babylon: The King's Treasure***

#### Stunts:
>**The Right Dingir**
>
>Gilgamesh's treasury contains treasures from all ages. From that treasury, he can materialize almost any object -- even another Servant's noble phantasm. However, your GM may say that you must invoke Gate of Babylon: The King's Treasure with a point of Pride to get it.

>**My Treasury Contains Thousands of Noble Phantasms**
> 
>When you Attack, you can invoke Gate of Babylon: The King's Treasure with a point of Pride to get +3 on the attack as you volley the contents of your limitless treasury at a foe.

> **Enuma Elish: The Star of Creation That Split Heaven and Earth**
> 
> Spend all of your remaining Pride in an all out Buster attack with the full power of Enuma Elish. Add +3 to the roll for each point of Pride spent on the attack.

## Magecraft
Each Master has a Magecraft, an extra that codifies the powers bestowed upon them by their family's Crest. Magecrafts are similar to Saint Graphs, but always includes an aspect to represent your character's Crest. This Crest Aspect serves as a permission to use magic in tandem with all of your character's skills and combat styles in whatever way your magecraft might benefit them.

### Example Magecraft: Projection (Trace Version)
> Projection magecraft can materialize the shape, substance, and _entire history_ of an object. Shirou has has 3 points of Mana that can be used to power his Magecraft Stunts. When Compelled or Hostilely Invoked, his Crest Aspect grants him Mana instead of Fate Points.
>
>Whenever you would increase his refresh, you may instead increase his Mana by 1 or add an additional Magecraft Stunt that uses Mana.

#### Resource:
Mana: 3/3

#### Crest Aspect: 

***Emiya Family Crest***

#### Stunts:
>**Trace On (Sword)**
>
>Spend up to two points of Mana when you're holding a weapon you can reinforce. Give it a weapon rating equal to the number of points you spend until the end of the scene.

>**Trace On (Shield)**
> 
>Spend up to two points of Mana when you're holding a defensive implement you can reinforce. Give it an armor rating equal to the number of points you spend until the end of the scene.

> **Unlimited Blade Works**
> 
> Spend 3 Mana to move yourself and everyone you specify in your zone to a new zone with the aspect **Reality Marble: Unlimited Blade Works** that takes +5 to remove. There is no way to enter or exit this zone without removing the aspect, which transports everyone back to the zone you came from. You may dismiss the aspect at any time, and this aspect is removed if you Concede or are Taken Out.
> 
> While in this zone, you gain weapon:3 by wielding the various storied blades you forged that litter the ground. These swords disappear when **Reality Marble: Unlimited Blade Works** is removed.
