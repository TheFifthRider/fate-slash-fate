# Combat Rules

In Fate, a full battle is called a Conflict, though we colloquially refer to it as Combat.

## Roar Phase
*(Source: [War of Ashes](https://fate-srd.com/war-ashes/advanced-conflict)*)

The Roar Phase is an optional prelude to combat. It is a moment to define the awesome way that your character is approaching the Conflict before them. Maybe you are ***Intensely Focused***, or maybe you have entered into a ***Berserk Rage*.

**Mechanically**, each participating combatant is Creating An Advantage to place a special Roar Aspect on themself. You Roll against a +2 with the Combat Style that most fits your intentions. 

However...
1. After a Player Roars, the GM then gets to do a Roar. The GM can create as many Aspects as there are Players who Roar, even if there are not as many enemies.
2. Your Roar reflects a highly focused mindset. You can only Attack with the Combat Style you used to Roar, or one of its Adjacent styles. See the chart below.

| Roar Style | Adjacent Styles |
| ---- | ---- |
| Buster | Wild, Brave |
| Wild | Buster, Quick |
| Quick | Wild, Sneaky |
| Sneaky | Quick, Arts |
| Arts | Sneaky, Brave | 
| Brave | Arts, Buster | 

You can visualize the relationship between Styles with this ring diagram:

```
      Buster
Brave         Wild
Arts          Quick
      Sneaky
```

!!! note "Modification From Original Rules"

    Under the original Fate rules, Failing your Roar roll would create a Consequence. 
    In Fate/moon, we will instead resolve this as you would any other Create An Advantage: the enemy gets a Free Invoke on the Aspect.


## Taking Turns

In Combat, every character gets a turn to act, as do [obstacles]. 

Bosses may receive multiple turns, and low-level "mooks" might share their place in the turn order even if there are multiple of them. Allied NPCs may be present but abstain from the turn order unless specifically called upon by the party.

One complete round of turns is called an Exchange.

#### The Nature Of Turns

Flavorfully, it is important to remember that turn-based battle does not mean your character is sitting around waiting for their turn on the XBox. You can always safely assume that your characters are trading blows, dodging, repositioning, preparing, etc. while others act, or that your actions are simultaneous to others. Your turn is simply when the camera zooms in on you for a significant development!

Brief dialogues are also perfectly fine to have during combat, but extended conversations may have to be paused until the next Exchange. One possible rule of thumb is to ask: "Would this fit on one page of manga?"

### Popcorn Initiative
*(The Fate SRD discusses this under [Elective Action Order](https://fate-srd.com/odds-ends/elective-action-order))*

Rather than rolling initiative to determine a fixed turn order, the flow of action is chosen dynamically under the Popcorn Initiative system. 

1. At the conclusion of your Turn, select a participant who has not yet taken their Turn in the current Exchange. 
2. Once they have completed their Turn, they will select another participant.
3. So on and so forth until the Exchange has been completed. 
4. Whoever finished the Exchange chooses the player to start the next Exchange. 
   Every participant is now available to act, though you cannot "popcorn" to yourself.

#### Understanding The Implications

You can "popcorn" to any participant, even if they are not your ally. As with Compels and Conceding, the Popcorn Initiative is a player decision and not a character one. Your character does not have to yield to an enemy to allow them to act; you the player are simply turning the camera. 

In fact, there can be many benefits to popcorning to an enemy. One strategic quirk of the Popcorn Initiative is that you may want to get the enemy's Turns out of the way! If you allow an enemy to have the last Turn in the Exchange, they may choose another enemy to start the next Exchange, and that enemy might then choose another enemy! On the other hand, letting your ally end the Exchange lets your team control the top of the turn order.

Of course, every battle will have its own strategies. Feel free to confer with your party to decide your preferred course of action.

## Zones

A battlefield is made up of Zones which. Zones can be big or small, and there can be as many or as few Zones as appropriate. Zones can even be created by major environmental changes or special abilities. 

No matter what the Zone physically is, the point of the Zone is to codify range. You can always target any person or thing in a Zone. Maybe you're narratively jumping and sprinting around, but you can reasonably reach anything in the Zone during your turn. A Zone might be enclosed within a barrier or exist on a different elevation, or it may simply end because the adjacent Zone is "far away" enough. 

### Attacking With Zones

If it makes narrative sense, you can perform a ranged attack across Zones. If there is another Zone across a ***Giant Chasm***, an Archer can shoot across the gap. If your opponent is in a Zone representing the top of a skyscraper, it could be a hard sell to shoot at them from the adjacent alleyway.

With an appropriate Stunt, you could certainly perform an Attack against every combatant in the Zone. This is distinct from a multi-target Attack. For a Zone Attack, each target will Roll to Defend against one total. 

### Movement

If nothing is in your way, you can move between Zones *in addition* to your Turn Action.

Otherwise, you may need to use your Turn Action to Overcome the impediment. It could be the natural environment, an enchantment binding you to the Zone, or a fellow combatant trying to stop your efforts. Failure prevents your efforts, *or* you can succeed at a cost. However, there is no "Attack of Opportunity" against you when your back is turned.

Conversely, you could also use your Turn Action to Overcome if you wanted to rush to any Zone on the map. The GM will set a difficulty for this, and it could be very high.
