# The Fate Point Economy

## Spending

The primary usage of Fate Points is to [Invoke and Compel Aspects](aspects), but they have other uses.

A Fate Point may be paid to Declare A Story Detail, such as establishing a relationship between you and a key NPC. Ideally, this should be rooted in one of your Aspects, but it is not an invocation since it cannot be done with a Free Invoke.

Fate Points can also be the cost required to activate a Stunt. However, it is strongly recommended to avoid designing a Stunt with this cost; Fate Point refresh can be exchanged for Stunts, so the creation of a Stunt is like a permanently spent Fate Point. Requiring a Fate Point cost for a Stunt is thus equivalent to losing 2FP, so it better feel like it's worth spending those 2FP.

Unlike vanilla Fate Core, Fate Points do not need to be spend to refuse Compels.

## Replenishing

Fate Points replenish automatically between sessions, *except* when continuing combat through multiple sessions.

Otherwise, Fate Points can be earned in three ways:
1. Accepting a Compel
2. Have your Character Aspects and Consequences invoked against you with Fate Points
3. Concede from a conflict

You *can* earn more Fate Points than your refresh number! 

## GM Fate Points

Unlike players, who have a number of Fate Points for their character, a GM's Fate Points are shared between all NPCs. 

GM Fate Points refresh every scene rather than every session.
