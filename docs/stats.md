# Skills and Combat Styles

Fate/moon uses a split list of stats: 12 Skills and 6 Combat Styles. 

This is in order to allow players to focus on non combat skills without feeling like they can’t function during combat, which is half the roleplay. Skills have been changed from the base game in order to fit Chaldea and also make some skills less useful which may have been overpowered and vice versa. 

In general, Skills are used for Overcomes and to Create an Advantage, while Combat Styles are more often used for Attacks and Defends. However, there may be situations where a Combat Style is more appropriate than a Skill.  

Stunts can create exceptions to the contexts in which Skills or Combat Styles are used. Different Skills may also be applicable to the same situation depending on the way in which a character chooses to handle the situation.

The following are Skills: 
1. Athletics
2. Crafts
3. Discover
4. Finesse
5. Insight
6. Research
7. Resourcefulness
8. Riding
9. Stealth
10. Strength
11. Sway
12. Will

The following are Combat Styles:
1. Buster
2. Wild
3. Quick
4. Sneaky
5. Arts
6. Brave

# Skills List

### Athletics

Used for anything that requires athletic skill or acumen in order to accomplish. Athletics will often be used to roll for climbing checks, speed challenges and dodging in a non combat situation. 

### Crafts

The ability to create. Whether it be mechanical skill or magical, this represents your ability to craft items from various sources. It also represents artistic prowess. Crafts will be called into question when attempting to make Advantages mostly, though it may be used in other ways.

### Discover

A combination of the old skill Notice and Investigate. Discover is the Skill used primarily to search for information or notice things within your vicinity. A player will use Discover to search rooms, notice incoming attacks and projectiles or search through stacks of documents or books. Discover is used when players don’t have time, otherwise use Research.

### Finesse

There is a difference between doing something and doing something skillfully. Anyone can paint but an artist is capable of masterpieces for instance. Finesse is used when fine motor skills or precision. Things like lockpicking, building mechanically complex machines, sleight of hand are all checks. Finesse can also be rolled to create Advantages that can be used with Crafts to make things otherwise not possible.

### Insight

A new form of Empathy, Insight is the ability to understand and evaluate human emotions. Insight is the collection of information in order to find common ground with others; unlike Sway which is a more forceful way of trying to get others to think the way you wish. Insight can also be used to discern hidden information but only from people, one must roll Discover in all other situations. 

### Research

In the world of Mages, having a skill like Research is very important. Research is rolled when you have ample time in order to search, learn or understand something. Research checks also help with magical and historical knowledge.

### Resourcefulness

Your ability to think quickly and solve problems on the fly. Things like survival and street skills. Resourcefulness is rolled when you need to make the best of a bad situation.

### Riding

The replacement of Drive. It's the same as it is in the base game however it has been renamed “Riding” for flavor. If one needs to drive a vehicle or ride an animal or any variation of such a thing, this is the skill that is called upon.

### Stealth

The ability to hide the presence of oneself. Also used for any action that one would try to hide or not be found out doing such as burglary. Stealth can often be used in opposition to checks such as Discover in order to keep low profiles.

### Strength

The physicality of the body, Strength is used for standard tests of endurance and might. Roll Strength for checks that require muscles! Really this one is easy right?

### Sway

The ability to change someone’s opinion whether by diplomacy or by force. This skill can be used for many things from brokering deals or forming alliances to intimidating enemies or even provoking someone. A combination of the old Skills Rapport, Provoke and Deceive. Your standard form of Charisma.

### Will

A character's mental fortitude. Used to overcome mental attacks or problems. It can also be used to withstand things that others might crumble at whether physical or mental.  

# Combat Styles

Approaches are used as a substitute for Skills in the Fate Accelerated system. We are using Approaches exclusively for combat. We will call these Combat Styles. Combat Styles are mostly just much more broad Skills. For combat we will be rolling these as a way to make a more specialized and unique combat system. These Combat Styles represent your character's skill in specific kinds of combat types. T

### Buster

Buster are power attacks. Attacks which focus on offensive and overwhelming power. Heavy weapons and attacks largely fall into Buster, however certain spells or abilities such as a Sabers standard beam attack might fall into this category as well. Buster is categorized as slow but powerful.

### Wild

Sometimes you just want to go ape shit on something. That is what Wild is. It's throwing all caution to the wind and just GOING. Wild attacks lack traditional combat technique instead focusing on dealing as much damage to an opponent as possible. Since they are less disciplined Wild attacks can be easy to take advantage of. Wild doesn’t just apply to Berserkers it can also apply to any primal or animalistic attack or even just when someone swings their sword with little thought.

### Quick

Quick attacks and combatants focus on overwhelming their opponent with speed and agility. Quick strikes and maneuvers are staples of the Quick combat style. This includes things like rapid fire projectiles. Quick users often are more defensively focused than the rest of the combat styles.

### Sneaky

Not all kinds of combat are fair. Any time you wish to use a backstab, throw sand in an enemies eyes or otherwise break “the rules” of combat you are performing a Sneaky action. Sneaky isn’t always necessarily stealthy, it can also be categorized as “dirty” ,“cheating” or “manipulative.” Though that's what the losers call it so take it with a grain of salt.

### Arts

Arts is used primarily for tradition forms of magic or energy manipulation. However it also can be used for techniques that require finesse or complicated thought processes to perform.

### Brave

Brave attacks are your standard trained combat. The sort of attack a knight or trained warrior would use. They are the middle ground focusing on offense and defense equally. Those who are not trained in standardized combat may have difficulty with Brave attacks as they come from rigid adherence to tradition and honor.

## Defending with a Combat Style

When rolling you roll against the opposing Combat Style of the opponent. If your opponent is rolling Quick you roll your Quick to defend. 

This is because while you may be well trained in traditional styles of combat (Brave) that doesn’t mean you can respond to attacks like Wild or Sneaky like you would if you were to clash swords with a fellow Brave warrior. With this system it is no longer viable to just take one stat and be good at all kinds of combat. 

When making your Stunts keep these stats in mind. For instance you could have a Stunt that activates when your opponent attempts to use Sneaky on you. Or you could spend an FP to defend with Brave instead of another stat. Or you could spend an FP to force an opponent to defend with their Wild stat.

# Stat Distribution

Fate Core’s Skill Pyramid system is absent in Fate/moon.

The stat layout for character creation is: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0

All Stats are capped at level 5.  

## Suggested Interpretations of Skill Values

What does rolling a number mean? [sic]

| # | Interpretation |
| -- | -----------------------------------------------| 
| 0 | A normal, untrained human has this stat. Its naturally what you can do as a member of the human race |
| 1 | Someone who knows the basics and has a surface level understanding, but are still more experienced than if they had just learned of the thing
| 2 | Well educated in the subject, but does not know the ins and outs of the craft
| 3 | Has performed the task or skill enough to have learned more than just book smarts. Can fundamentally understand things that someone who isnt as experienced in said field would not understand.
| 4 | a professional, likely this stat is a focus of their life.
| 5 | a master, someone who knows the stat inside and out. The difference between say a painter with some works in an art gallery vs a painter who can make a fortune off their paintings
| 6 | a genius, someone who understands the stat more than most people on the planet
| 7 | a godlike command over the stat, something most mortals could not achieve.
