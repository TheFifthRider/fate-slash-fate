# Class System & Class Stunts

The Class System of the Holy Grail War is sort of important to the whole Fate universe thing, so we have given each class something special to call their own. This will make Classes feel less like an arbitrary descriptor and more like what they are actually supposed to be in the universe of Fate. When creating a Servant, you are given a free aspect and stunt upon choice of your class.

## Saber					
Aspect:	***Combat Prowess***				
Stunt:	When you Tie or Succeed with Style on an Attack, create an Aspect with a free invoke (replacing the boost).		

## Lancer					
Aspect:	***Fast and Agile***				
Stunt:	You get +2 when splitting your effort on an Attack. (You split your effort when you have multiple targets, you must assign at least 1 shift each)

## Archer					
Aspect:	***Archer's Sight***				
Stunt:	You can invoke Archer's Sight to increase the range of an action to anything you can (reasonably) see.
