# Scheduled Advancement

Rather than burden GMs with needing to figure out when to give us advancement, why not just make it happen on a regular cadence?

The following system assumes ~2 hour sessions. If your sessions are shorter or longer, you may want to increase or decrease the number of sessions before leveling up.

Every **ten sessions**, level up! 

* If it's an odd multiple of ten (10, 30, 50, 70, 90), increase the rating of up to two combat styles by a total of two steps
* If it's an even multiple of ten (20, 40, 60, 80, 100), increase the rating of up to three skills by a total of three steps

Every **landmark** (enemy servant in a Grail War defeated, Singularity complete, Lostbelt denied), get +1 refresh!

Every **100 sessions**, increase the maximum value that skills and combat styles can be increased to by 1.

## Advancement with multiple groups

If you have multiple groups that play at the same time (commonly referred to as Westmarches style), and wish to keep players evenly leveled, base advancement on the **total number of sessions** across all groups. As with session length, you may need to tweak the number of sessions per advancement.

## Example Progression Table

For convenience, if you use the system set forth above the following table will tell you the maximum number of points you should have distributed over your combat styles and skills, as well as the current maximum.

| Sessions | Combat Styles | Skills | Max |
| -------- | ------------- | ------ | --- |
| 0        | 10            | 15     | +5  |
